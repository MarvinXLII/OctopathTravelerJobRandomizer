**ABOUT**

This is the beginnings of a Job randomizer for Octopath Traveler (Steam version).

**OPTIONS**

Several options are available:

- Skills: shuffles all skills among jobs.

- Costs: shuffles the JP costs of skills (NB: these will be sorted in increasing order).

- Support Skills: shuffles support skills among jobs.

**WARNINGS**

The "Skills" shuffler is a bit risky for Chapter 1, as neighther enemy
nor boss weaknesses are considered at this point.  With this option,
you MIGHT be better off starting from a saved game after beating all
of the first chapters.

Both "Support Skills" and "Costs" should be safe options for a full
playthrough.

**FUTURE WORK**

Future releases will hopefully include:

- Shuffling/modifying secondary job stats.

- Shuffling/randomizing equippable weapons (currently leads to
  in-battle side-effects at the moment).

- Shuffling base Jobs of the PCs.

- Other random stuff!

**Usage**

Run the executable from the Releases section. When finished, copy the
"JobData_P.pak" into the "PAKS" folder in you game.
